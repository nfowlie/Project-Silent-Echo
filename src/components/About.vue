            <br/><br/> Silent Echo Music Publishing was founded over 20 years ago with a focus on bringing great songs from
            song writers and independent recording artists to the global market place for use in TV, Film,
            Commercials, Gaming and Multi-Media synchronization applications.
            <br/><br/> Silent Echo has a proven track record licensing songs to major media outlets including Sony Pictures, CBS

            allowing us to opened up new markets for their songs and generate additional revenue for the artist.
